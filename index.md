Designed as a way to use Revolt on KaiOS phones, Unvolt is a simple client which should work on most old and obscure devices. It's very simplistic and should allow for near perfect performance and universal compatibility.

Unvolt is built on Reductv3 by DoruDoLasu. You can view it's source code on *[Github](https://github.com/DoruDoLasu/Reduct)*.
