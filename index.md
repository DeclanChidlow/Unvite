Initially designed as a way to use [Revolt](https://revolt.chat) on KaiOS phones, Unvite is a minimalist, unofficial client aimed at providing broad compatibility with various old and obscure devices. Its simplicity ensures near-perfect performance and universal compatibility.

Note that Unvite will no longer receive updates. While it should continue to function unless significant changes are made to Revolt, I have decided to cease further development and support. This decision stems from my disappointment with Revolt's management and my complete loss of faith in the project's future.
