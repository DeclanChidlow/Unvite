A minimal Revolt client
</div>
<br/>

A minimalist, unofficial client which should work on most old and obscure devices.

> [!WARNING]
> Unvite will no longer receive updates. While it should continue to function unless significant changes are made to Revolt, I have decided to cease further development and support. This decision stems from my disappointment with Revolt's management and my complete loss of faith in the project's future.

## Development

This repository includes both the Unvite app and its associated site, developed using Jekyll. To contribute to Unvite, you'll need to use Jekyll for any further development.

## Acknowledgements

Unvite is based on [Reduct v3 by Doru](https://codeberg.org/Doru/ReductV3).
